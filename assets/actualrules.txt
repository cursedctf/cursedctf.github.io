These are the actual rules. Acknowledge them for a flag

1. Don't attack the infrastructure unless explicitly encouraged.
2. Do not harass people or attempt to dox/hack any competitors or organizers beyond those explicitly listed. This includes stuff like racism, homophobia, etc. We will not tolerate it on the server.
3. Don't commit crimes please, this is satire and we don't want to get sued or go to jail. Stay in the listed areas. Make noise online all you want, be annoying but don't break shit.
4. Don't take things out of hand. If things out of hand we will have no choice but to actually shut down the event
